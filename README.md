# AWS Route53 Monitoring Extension

## Use Case
Captures Route53 statistics from Amazon CloudWatch and displays them in the AppDynamics Metric Browser.

**Note : By default, the Machine agent can only send a fixed number of metrics to the controller. This extension potentially reports thousands of metrics, so to change this limit, please follow the instructions mentioned [here](https://docs.appdynamics.com/display/PRO40/Metrics+Limits).**

## Installation

1. Run 'mvn clean install' from aws-route53-monitoring-extension
2. Copy and unzip AWSRoute53Monitor-\<version\>.zip from 'target' directory into \<machine_agent_dir\>/monitors/
3. Edit config.yaml file in AWSRoute53Monitor/conf and provide the required configuration (see Configuration section)
4. Restart the Machine Agent.

## Configuration

### config.yaml

**Note: Please avoid using tab (\t) when editing yaml files. You may want to validate the yaml file using a [yaml validator](http://yamllint.com/).**

**Below is an example config for monitoring multiple accounts and regions:**

~~~
accounts:
  - awsAccessKey: "XXXXXXXX1"
    awsSecretKey: "XXXXXXXXXX1"
    displayAccountName: "TestAccount_1"
    regions: ["us-east-1","us-west-1","us-west-2"]

  - awsAccessKey: "XXXXXXXX2"
    awsSecretKey: "XXXXXXXXXX2"
    displayAccountName: "TestAccount_2"
    regions: ["eu-central-1","eu-west-1"]

credentialsDecryptionConfig:
    enableDecryption: "false"
    decryptionKey:

proxyConfig:
    host:
    port:
    username:
    password:    

metricsConfig:
    metricTypes:
      - metricName: "CurrItems"
        statType: "max"

      - metricName: "DecrHits"
        statType: "sum"        

    excludeMetrics: ["DeleteMisses", "Get.*"]

    metricsTimeRange:
      startTimeInMinsBeforeNow: 5
      endTimeInMinsBeforeNow: 0

    maxErrorRetrySize: 0

concurrencyConfig:
  noOfAccountThreads: 3
  noOfRegionThreadsPerAccount: 3
  noOfMetricThreadsPerRegion: 3

metricPrefix: "Custom Metrics|Amazon Route53|"
~~~

## Metrics
Typical metric path: **Application Infrastructure Performance|\<Tier\>|Custom Metrics|Amazon Route53|\<Account Name\>|\<Region\>|HealthCheck Id|\<HealthCheck Id\>** followed by the metrics defined in the link below:

- [Route53 Metrics](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/DeveloperGuide/r53-metricscollected.html)

## Credentials Encryption
Please visit [this page](https://community.appdynamics.com/t5/Knowledge-Base/How-to-use-Password-Encryption-with-Extensions/ta-p/29397) to get detailed instructions on password encryption. The steps in this document will guide you through the whole process.

## Extensions Workbench

Workbench is an inbuilt feature provided with each extension in order to assist you to fine tune the extension setup before you actually deploy it on the controller. Please review the following document on [How to use the Extensions WorkBench](https://community.appdynamics.com/t5/Knowledge-Base/How-to-use-the-Extensions-WorkBench/ta-p/30130)

## Troubleshooting

Please follow the steps listed in this [troubleshooting-document](https://community.appdynamics.com/t5/Knowledge-Base/How-to-troubleshoot-missing-custom-metrics-or-extensions-metrics/ta-p/28695) in order to troubleshoot your issue. These are a set of common issues that customers might have faced during the installation of the extension. If these don't solve your issue, please follow the last step on the [troubleshooting-document](https://community.appdynamics.com/t5/Knowledge-Base/How-to-troubleshoot-missing-custom-metrics-or-extensions-metrics/ta-p/28695) to contact the support team.

## Support Tickets

If after going through the [Troubleshooting Document](https://community.appdynamics.com/t5/Knowledge-Base/How-to-troubleshoot-missing-custom-metrics-or-extensions-metrics/ta-p/28695) you have not been able to get your extension working, please file a ticket and add the following information.

Please provide the following in order for us to assist you better.

1. Stop the running machine agent.
2. Delete all existing logs under `<MachineAgent>/logs`.
3. Please enable debug logging by editing the file `<MachineAgent>/conf/logging/log4j.xml`. Change the level value of the following `<logger>` elements to debug.
   ```
   <logger name="com.singularity">
   <logger name="com.appdynamics">
   ```
4. Start the machine agent and please let it run for 10 mins. Then zip and upload all the logs in the directory `<MachineAgent>/logs/*`.
5. Attach the zipped `<MachineAgent>/conf/*` directory here.
6. Attach the zipped `<MachineAgent>/monitors/ExtensionFolderYouAreHavingIssuesWith` directory here.
